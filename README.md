# OS/2 GPI Font Tools

This project contains a collection of tools and code samples for dealing with OS/2
fonts in various GPI-specific formats.

Currently these are:

- compfont: An incomplete graphical editor/inspector for some special OS/2 composite font formats.
- parser: Standalone reference code for parsing OS/2 GPI's native bitmap font format. It should have no dependencies on any OS/2 API.

Different licenses (GPLv3, FreeType, and/or public domain) are used for various parts of these projects; see the individual source files for details.
